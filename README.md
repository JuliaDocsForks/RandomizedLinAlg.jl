# RandomizedAlgorithms.jl

RandomizedAlgorithms.jl is a Julia package that provides some randomized algorithms for numerical linear algebra as advocated in [1].

This package was split off from IterativeSolvers.jl as randomized algorithms were not considered well-established and potentially unstable.
